# Unifi Protect Examples

Various example using the [Unifi Protect Library](https://github.com/XciD/unifi-protect)

# Use cases

I've developed those examples in order to integrate an Unifi Doorbell with a Loxone Domotic Solution.

- `cameratosip` allow you to call the doorbell with the loxone application
- `hook` give you a notification on the loxone app when some ring
- `snapshot` return a better solution for the get image in the loxone app
